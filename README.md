# Neural Network training, constraint solving and sudoku to connect the two
Notebooks for a hands-on session on training a digit classifier and using it to solve visual sudoku's.

* p0: to help you test that all necessary software is installed
* p1: first part, training an mnist digit recognizer, predicting and solving a sudoku grid
* p2: second part, predicting the grid probabilities and solving a maximum-likelihood visual sudoku

## Installation instructions:
* if (you do not have 'conda' or 'pip' on your machine):<br />
  -> install miniconda as per https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
* if (yo do not have 'classic Jupyter Notebook' on your machine):<br />
  -> 'conda install -c conda-forge notebook', see https://jupyter.org/install
* download the p0 file to a folder, run 'jupyter notebook' in that folder, open p0, read it and test...

## Usage instructions:
Each of the notebooks can be run as-is, but they don't do meaningful things yet.

The proposed approach is to read and execute it cell-by-cell, modifying parts if you want to experiment or understand better.

At some point, you will encounter a **Task:** description which challenges you to do or add a missing component.


<br />Have Fun!
