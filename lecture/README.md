## Summary for the __Data Science Principles__ slides (part1a_datascience.pdf):

* The talk explains the basic strengths and weaknesses of data science / machine learning, through 5 principles.

## Summary for the __Learning from user and environment in combinatorial optimisation__ slides (part1b and part 2):

* Increasingly, the knowledge needed to formulate constraint optimisation problems is not explicitly written down. Instead, we have to infer part of the knowledge implicitely from the users, (such as preferences), or through perception (image recognition) or the environment (price predictions). In this talk I motivate this change in requirements and the challenges it poses with respect to modeling and (re)formulating such data-driven constraint solving problems, as well as different techniques to hybredize and integrate the learning, the predictions and the reasoning.
